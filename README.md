•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
-They needed an application that could keep track of inventory and notify the user when the count reached zero and allow for users to create accounts and log into the accounts. They also wanted the users to be able to change counts too. 

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I needed a main screen, a screen for logging in, a screen for the lists of items that were more of a grid that would go onto the tools screen, and a screen for adding items. I think it was successful since they worked together in a modular way. 

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I had a base line for the UI when I created that and then I looked at how others created similar components when working on the login, the grid, and the databases and used that to help me form how I wanted mine to be and worked on making each piece work together. 

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I created accounts that allowed me to enter into the application and test each feature, I also tried using the log since it has some good information, but it was cluttered and so I also used the alert since I could pass through variables which helped me find that my data wasn’t coming though at first. I also had a list of items before using SQLite to read the items from the database which allowed me to solve some problems I may have found before getting to that part. 

•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I used a list to find out if my grid was working correctly and this allowed me to limit the number of issues I might be facing if I had just tried to use a database. 

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I don’t about particularly successful but one of the first hurdles I had was making sure that the notify worked correctly, I felt very accomplished after finishing it before a new bug came up. I think another is getting the item buttons to work successfully along with the items showing. I still want to get them to update right after clicking the buttons when it comes to the items on the grid. I think my knowledge of SQL helped and I was able to demonstrate that a bit.
